## Requirements to test the api

* Make sure you have sql server and SSMS installed, the DB that the app communicates with is the local mssql db

* After installing SSMS, insert a user by hand -> it has 2 properties firstname and surname

`ex: insert into dbo.Users Values ('Firas', 'Mk')`

After this step, launch the API and swagger should appear in your default browser window.
